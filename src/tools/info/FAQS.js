      'Rapid Test and PCR Test: This test will detect if you are actively infected with the COVID-19 virus. ',
      'Serum Antibody IgG (Blood Test): This test will detect if you have had prior exposure to or infection with COVID-19 and have built antibodies for the virus.

As COVID-19 is a novel (new) infection, it is unclear if a positive antibody offers immunity. UrgentMD recommends universal precautions (Hand washing, social distancing and masks when appropriate).',
